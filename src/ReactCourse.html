                    <h1>React course</h1>
                    <h2>First lesson</h2>
                    <p> When creating react component we use class as in javascript but it has to extend react component
                        and it must have at least one method render which must return an element.
                    </p>
                    <p> You can only return one element in jsx, for example a division, and you cannot use class as a
                        keyword because it's reserved for creating classes, use className instead.
                    </p>
                    <p> To render the react component we have to stick it in react DOM. The render method has two parameters,
                        the first says which component we want to render and the second says where we want to render our
                        component. We use the html element signs and the name of our react component for react components
                        and in this case we want to render it to the division which is name app, therefore we can search
                        it by id in this document. We also use babel to help the syntax in browsers by adding the script
                        in the head. React is good for outputting dynamic js content in p tag in curly braces which is
                        the main point in react. Like a random number for example.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        {Math.random() * 10}
                    </p>

                    <h2>Second lesson</h2>
                    <p> Another extremely important part of react is state of a component. State describes the data of a
                        component or UI-state. State dynamically updates the output of the data which are stored locally.
                        There are multiple ways of implementation of the state of a react component, one of them being
                        defining state property inside the javascript class itself as a javascript object and inserting
                        the data it begins with when it first loads. When we want to use the state we have to use the word
                        this which refers to this react component or something else to identify the component. For example:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My name is {this.state.name} and I am {this.state.age}
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can also define a state in the constructor method.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Third lesson</h2>
                    <p onCopy={this.handleParagraphCopy}>This lesson we will be handling events first of all
                        we will create a button with a js function which triggers on click. This particular
                        function will only say in the console on what did the user click. We have to remember to refer
                        to the function with this because it's inside this particular component. Also it is important
                        to note that we don't want to invoke the function with parentheses. Same with the second button
                        only we handle the mouse over event. Last thing we do is to handle the event when someone tries
                        to copy this paragraph.
                    </p>
                    <button onClick={this.handleButtonClick}>Click me</button>
                    <button onMouseOver={this.handleButtonHover}>Hover me</button>

                    <h2>Fourth lesson</h2>
                    <p> In this lesson we'll learn how to change the state of a component with an event handler. When
                        we want to use this keyword in a function it won't work since it won't know what is this referring
                        to. If it's an arrow function though it will refer to the component and we will be able to use
                        this keyword. Example would be the click handler from last lesson. Also when changing the state
                        of the component we shouldn't change the state directly, instead we should use set state.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Fifth lesson</h2>
                    <p> In this lesson we'll create a simple form in which the user will be able to submit their name.
                        We use the form to do that. Interesting is that onSubmit captures both when user presses enter
                        and when they click on a button inside the form. We don't want the page to refresh when user
                        submits their answer therefore we change the default behavior in the js function.
                    </p>
                    <h3> My name is {this.state.name} </h3>
                    <form onSubmit={this.handleFormSubmit}>
                        <input type="text" onChange={this.handleFormChange} />
                        <button> Submit </button>
                    </form>
                </div>
            )
        }
    }
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
